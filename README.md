# Visual Basic Design and Features Register Login Account

This project is the development and implementation of a Visual Basic-based application programme, which begins with the creation of a Register and Login Form. This project was first created in 2024, when I was still in my Senior School education to support my learning and develop my programming skills.

The main goal of this project is to serve as a foundation for developing more comprehensive applications over time, which will no doubt be optimised and developed into products with strong business cases. This project will also serve as the foundation for developing a business idea and brand name that I will develop professionally.

By adhering to the source code and assets associated with remaining protected, I look forward to developing this innovation in a calm and organised manner before introducing it to the wider market.
